## Sequoia, a simple static-site generator

Created for Professor Hamid's CSC-207 class.

In order to use, download the jar from GitHub releases, build with Maven using your IDE,
and execute the dev.flum.sequoia.cli.Main class inside the folder you want to create
the project directory, e.g. `java Main new`,
then use `java Main build` in the directory to
build.

Alternatively, create a symlink to run the jar as an installed
application.
