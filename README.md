## Sequoia, a simple static-site generator

Created for Professor Hamid's CSC-207 class.

In order to use, download the jar from GitHub releases,
and execute the jar inside the folder you want to create
the project directory, e.g. `java dev.flum.sequoia.jar new`,
then use `java dev.flum.sequoia.jar` in the directory to
build.

Alternatively, create a symlink to run the jar as an installed
application.
